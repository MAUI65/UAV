## Guide to developing UAV

For a step-by-step guide to using nbdev [guide to using
nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html) You’ll need the
following software to develope using nbdev:

1.  Python venv
2.  A Python package manager: ie pip
3.  Jupyter Notebook

``` sh
pip install jupyter
```

4.  nbdev

``` sh
pip install nbdev
```

5.  Quarto

``` sh
nbdev_install_quarto
```

6.  Install Quarto JupyterLab extension

``` sh
pip install jupyterlab-quarto
```

7.  Install nbdev pre-commit hooks to catch and fix uncleaned and
    unexported notebooks

``` sh
pip install pre-commit
```

see [nbdev Pre-Commit
Hooks](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/pre_commit.html) for more details

``` python
12+1222
```

### Build the library

``` sh
pip install UAV
```

### Preview Docs

Start the preview by entering this into your terminal:

``` sh
nbdev_preview
```

### Prepare your changes

Before commiting your changes to GitHub we recommend running
`nbdev_prepare` in the terminal,

which bundles the following commands:

- `nbdev_export`: Builds the `.py` modules from Jupyter notebooks
- `nbdev_test`: Tests your notebooks
- `nbdev_clean`: Cleans your notebooks to get rid of extreanous output
  for git
- `nbdev_readme`: Updates your repo’s `README.md` file from your index
  notebook.

### Push to GitHub

You can now commit and push your changes to GitHub. As we mentioned
before, always remember to run `nbdev_prepare` before you commit to
ensure your modules are exported and your tests pass. You can use
`git status` to check which files have been generated or changed. Then:

``` sh
git add .
git commit -m 'Add `say_hello`; update index' # Update this text with your own message
git push
```

This will kick-off your GitHub Actions. Wait a minute or two for those
to complete, then check your updated repo and documentation.
