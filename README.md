## Guide to developing UAV

### Initial setup

For a step-by-step guide to using nbdev [guide to using
nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html) You’ll need the
following software to develope using nbdev:

1.  Python venv
2.  A Python package manager: ie pip
3.  Jupyter Notebook

``` sh
pip install jupyter
```

4.  nbdev

``` sh
pip install nbdev
```

5.  Quarto

``` sh
nbdev_install_quarto
```

6.  Install Quarto JupyterLab extension

``` sh
pip install jupyterlab-quarto
```

7.  Install nbdev pre-commit hooks to catch and fix uncleaned and
    unexported notebooks

``` sh
pip install pre-commit
```

see [nbdev Pre-Commit
Hooks](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/pre_commit.html) for more details

### Build the library

``` sh
pip install UAV
```

### Preview Docs

Start the preview by entering this into your terminal:

``` sh
nbdev_preview
```

### Prepare your changes

Before commiting your changes to GitHub we recommend running
`nbdev_prepare` in the terminal,

which bundles the following commands:

- `nbdev_export`: Builds the `.py` modules from Jupyter notebooks
- `nbdev_test`: Tests your notebooks
- `nbdev_clean`: Cleans your notebooks to get rid of extreanous output
  for git
- `nbdev_readme`: Updates your repo’s `README.md` file from your index
  notebook.

### Push to GitHub

You can now commit and push your changes to GitHub. As we mentioned
before, always remember to run `nbdev_prepare` before you commit to
ensure your modules are exported and your tests pass. You can use
`git status` to check which files have been generated or changed. Then:

``` sh
git add .
git commit -m 'Add `say_hello`; update index' # Update this text with your own message
git push
```

This will kick-off your GitHub Actions. Wait a minute or two for those
to complete, then check your updated repo and documentation.

### Set up autoreload

Since you’ll be often updating your modules from one notebook, and using
them in another, it’s helpful if your notebook automatically reads in
the new modules as soon as the Python file changes. To make this happen,
just add these lines to the top of your notebook:

``` sh
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```
