    "- **UAV software** is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that are used to develop and test UAV software. The notebooks are organized into a library, and the library is used to create a documentation website and a Python package that can be installed with `pip` or `conda`  (see [nbdev template](tutorials/template.ipynb) for an example) \n",
    "- \n",
    "- **Documentation** is automatically generated using [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) & [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Docs support LaTeX, are searchable, and are automatically hyperlinked (including out-of-the-box support for many packages via [`nbdev-index`](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev-index))\n",
    "- **Publish packages to PyPI and conda** as well as tools to simplify package releases.  Python best practices are automatically followed, for example, only exported objects are included in `__all__`\n",
    "- **Two-way sync between notebooks and plaintext source code** allowing you to use your IDE for code navigation or quick edits\n",
    "- **Tests** written as ordinary notebook cells are run in parallel with a single command\n",
    "- **Continuous integration** out-of-the-box with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that run your tests and rebuild your docs\n",
    "- **Git-friendly notebooks** with [Jupyter/Git hooks](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/git_friendly_jupyter.html) that clean unwanted metadata and render merge conflicts in a human-readable format\n",
